# Empowering Nile’s Marketing: Predictive Modelling for Customer Reviews  

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict customers likely to leave positive reviews on **Nile**, a South American eCommerce platform. Positive reviews are vital for Nile’s online reputation and sales growth. The model enables targeted marketing incentives to encourage more positive feedback cost-effectively.

Following the CRISP-DM methodology, the project includes data preparation, feature engineering, model development, evaluation, and deployment planning.

## Key Highlights

- **Data Used:** Order reviews, orders, and order items datasets with relevant features such as delivery time, freight percentage, and purchase details.
- **Modelling Approaches Tested:** Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (GBDT), and XGBoost across multi-class, three-class, and binary classification of review scores.
- **Best Model:** Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) binary classifier with 82% accuracy, though challenges with class imbalance and underfitting remain.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creation of new features like on-time delivery, delivery time (days), total order value, and freight percentage.
- **Deployment Considerations:** Integration with Nile’s CRM and ERP, team training, monitoring, privacy and GDPR compliance, and ethical concerns.

## Repository Contents

- **Data Preparation & Cleaning:** Python scripts and notebooks for joining datasets, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
- **Modelling:** Code implementing machine learning algorithms, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.
- **Technical Report:** Detailed PDF report (1990 words) outlining business understanding, data analysis, modelling, evaluation, and deployment strategy.
- **Presentation:** Slides and video recording of the client-facing pitch.
- **Meeting Minutes:** Documentation of team collaboration and task assignments.

## Tools & Technologies
